Good Morning,

I'm Gabriel Rodrigues Vergari.

This Project was done in Unreal Engine 4.27

We have 2 folders here. 
Evolution_Server is a server, as i didn't manage to connect with your server,
i did mine to test the connection of the websocket. 
Evolution_Build is the build of the game.

Instructions:
Left Click: Click On the Square, showing mine or destroying it
Right Click: Mark, making it not clickable anymore

Any questions, send me an email at gabrielvergari@hotmail.com.

Thank you!
